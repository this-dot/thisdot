<h2>Apprenticeship</h2>

<h3>We do apprenticeship 2 ways. The first one is through placing apprentices in your company (we definitely have to elaborate more here). The 2nd is an actual apprenticeship program in which we enable developers in your company to go through a 3 week program that jumpstarts their ability to maneuver through a framework (needs some cleaning here as well).</h3>
