### Find a technical leader to guide you through your upgrade

Upgrading large production applications can be prohibitive and difficult.

The risk of regression can outweigh the benefit of upgrading.

Modern web applications written with frameworks like Angular, Ember, React, and Polymer on the latest version provide many benefits such as

- Provide performance improvements
- Improved user experiences
- Leverage millions of dollars of free open source development

We help upgrade applications by designing strategies to match business and technical needs.
