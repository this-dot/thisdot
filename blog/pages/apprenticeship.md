### Apprentices

This.Labs offers a program designed to help aspiring developers bridge the gap between bootcamp and landing a first job. We offer developers a unique opportunity to learn from the best while getting paid to develop their code skills. 

### Partners

We work with companies that offer small, short-term contracts that can be completed by an individual or a small team. All of our contracting partners are curated to fit the needs of the apprentice program.

## Mentors

Each apprentice has a personal mentor that guides their learning progress and ensures that the project is developed using best practices.
